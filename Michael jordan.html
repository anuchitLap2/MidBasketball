            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Michael jordan Michael Jeffrey Jordan (born February 17, 1963), also known by his initials MJ,
             is an American former professional basketball player and businessman.
             His biography on the official National Basketball Association (NBA) website states:
             "By acclamation, Michael Jordan is the greatest basketball player of all time."
             He was integral in helping to popularize the NBA around the world in the 1980s and 1990s,
             becoming a global cultural icon in the process.[11] Jordan played 15 seasons in the NBA,
             winning six championships with the Chicago Bulls. He is the principal owner and chairman
             of the Charlotte Hornets of the NBA and of 23XI Racing in the NASCAR Cup Series.

            Jordan played college basketball for three seasons under coach Dean 
            Smith with the North Carolina Tar Heels. As a freshman, he was a member of 
            the Tar Heels' national championship team in 1982. Jordan joined 
            the Bulls in 1984 as the third overall draft pick, and quickly emerged as a league star,
            entertaining crowds with his prolific scoring while gaining a reputation as one of the game's 
            best defensive players.[12] His leaping ability, demonstrated by performing slam dunks 
            from the free throw line in Slam Dunk Contests, earned him the nicknames "Air Jordan" and 
            "His Airness". Jordan won his first NBA championship with the Bulls in 1991, and followed that achievement with titles in 1992 and 1993,
            securing a "three-peat". Jordan abruptly retired from basketball before the 1993–94 NBA
            season to play Minor League Baseball but returned to the Bulls in March 1995 and led them to
            three more championships in 1996, 1997, and 1998, as well as a then-record 72 regular 
            season wins in the 1995–96 NBA season. He retired for the second time in January 1999 
            but returned for two more NBA seasons from 2001 to 2003 as a member of the Washington Wizards.
